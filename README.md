# Inciting speech classification (GPT-5 mini)

This code classifies inciting speech in the INCITE dataset using GPT-5 mini,
identifying categories of Identity attacks, Imputed Misdeeds, Exhortations, or
None. We evaluate the model's performance using zero-shot and few-shot prompting
strategies and compute comprehensive classification metrics.
